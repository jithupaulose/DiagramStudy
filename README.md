Onprem-to-Analytics AWS Pipeline

Abstract: The Onprem-to-Analytics AWS Pipeline is a serverless data processing and analytics pipeline that allows organizations to migrate their on-premises servers to AWS and gain insights into their application's performance. The pipeline starts with an on-premises server that is migrated to AWS and configured with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and API Gateway. Incoming traffic is then processed by a Lambda function, and the results are stored in S3. Glue crawlers extract metadata from the data stored in S3 and store it in the Glue Data Catalog. Finally, Athena is used to analyze the metadata and gain insights into the application's performance, which can be visualized and analyzed using a business intelligence tool.
